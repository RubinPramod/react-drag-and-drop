# React Tile Grid with Drag-and-Drop

This project is a React application that allows users to interact with a grid of tiles containing a message and date. Users can rearrange the tiles using drag-and-drop functionality, toggle between an initial and sorted order, and add new tiles through a form. The grid is responsive, and the app is styled using Tailwind CSS.

## Features:
- **Drag-and-Drop Tiles**: Tiles can be reordered within the grid using drag-and-drop, without relying on external libraries.
- **Sort by Date**: Tiles are grouped by year and can be sorted by date with a button toggle.
- **Add New Tile**: A form allows users to add new tiles with a date and message.
- **Responsive Design**: The app uses Tailwind CSS to ensure the grid is responsive and visually appealing.

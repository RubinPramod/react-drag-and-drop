# React custom Drag-and-Drop

This project is a React application that allows users to interact with cards containing a message and date. Users can rearrange the cards using drag-and-drop functionality, toggle between an initial and sorted order, and add new message through a form. The view is responsive, and the app is styled using Tailwind CSS.

## Features:
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Messages can be reordered within the grid using drag-and-drop, without relying on external libraries.
- **Sort by Date**: Messages are grouped by year and can be sorted by date with a button toggle.
- **Add New Message**: A form allows users to add a new message with a date and message.
- **Responsive Design**: The app uses Tailwind CSS to ensure the grid is responsive and visually appealing.
